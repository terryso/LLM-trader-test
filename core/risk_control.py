    4. Resets daily_loss_triggered to False

    IMPORTANT: This function does NOT automatically deactivate Kill-Switch.
    Users must explicitly call /resume confirm after /reset_daily to resume
    trading. This design prevents accidental resumption after large losses.

    Args:
        state: The mutable RiskControlState instance to update.
        current_equity: Current total equity to use as the new daily baseline.
        reason: The reason for the reset (for audit logging).

    Returns:
        A new RiskControlState with updated daily baseline fields.

      the persisted state.
    - If KILL_SWITCH env var is not set, the persisted state is preserved.
